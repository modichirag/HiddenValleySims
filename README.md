# HiddenValleySims
This repository provides some example codes to read-in and do basic analysis using Hidden Valley Simulation suite as described in the paper Modi et.al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11923 <br>

The code is primarily written in python3 and uses the following packages for I/O and analysis that we highly recommend be used.
- For handling particle meshes : https://github.com/rainwoodman/pmesh
- For analysis : https://github.com/bccp/nbodykit
- For I/O : https://github.com/rainwoodman/bigfile


*This repository is under active developement and currently committed code is placeholder and untested*
